I was a research master student in [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk) under the supervision of prof. [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), an intern at HKUST under the supervision of prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/), and an intern at SJTU under the supervision of prof. [Paul Weng](http://weng.fr/).
My research interest lies in post-training, activating the capabilities of foundation models by learning from feedback.
