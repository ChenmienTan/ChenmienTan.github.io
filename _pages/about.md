I am an M.Res. student in [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk) advised by [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) and intern in [UIUCNLP](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html) advised by [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html).
Prior to that, I interned at HKUST under the supervision of [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) and SJTU under the supervision of [Paul Weng](http://weng.fr/).
My interest lies in enabling language models to learn from feedback.
I will join [WestlakeNLP](https://westlake-nlp.github.io) as intern advised by [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io).
I am looking for PhD position in 2025 Fall.
