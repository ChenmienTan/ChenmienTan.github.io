I am currently an M.Res. student at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of prof. [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/)
as a member of the [Cohort](https://bollin.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group.
Prior to that, I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and prof. [Paul Weng](http://weng.fr/) at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My interest lies in how data affect the behaviors of Language Models and how to control the effect.
For more information, see my [CV](https://chenmientan.github.io/files/CV.pdf), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chenmientan), and [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/tanchenmien).
I am looking for fully funded PhD position starting from 2024 fall.
